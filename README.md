# OLYMPICS_DATA_EDA_PYTHON_PROJECT

The ‘dataset on the modern Olympic Games’ comprises all the Games from Athens
1986 to Rio 2016. The Olympics is more than just a quadrennial multi-sport
world championship. It is a lens through which to understand global history,
including shifting geopolitical power dynamics, women’s empowerment, and the
evolving values of society.
In this analysis, our goal is to shed light on major patterns in Olympic history.
How many athletes, sports, and nations are there? Where do most athletes
come from? Who wins medals? What are the characteristic of the athletes (e.g.,
gender and physical size)?

Olympics data contains 271,116 rows and 17 columns with details of athletes,
events and medals won.
Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual
Olympic event (athlete-events). The columns are: `ID - Unique number for each
athlete
